## Travel Agency
The project that I chose for my DataBase course is a Travel Agency.

### How does it work?
The data model manages information related to the organization and operation of activities within a travel agency. Their proper functioning is ensured by the employees of the agency who can be of several types: accountant, tourist guide or sales agent. Every employee has an employment contract. Customers who choose to organize their vacation with the help of the travel agency turn to the company's sales agents. The agent analyzes the client's requirements and offers them the best holiday offer. When customers accept the offer, they book a room that can have more facilities. The offer presented by the agent has a specific destination and may include transport that is provided by companies specialized in this field.
